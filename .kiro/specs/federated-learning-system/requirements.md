# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a federated learning system that enables privacy-preserving image classification. The system allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a CNN model without sharing raw data, using differential privacy techniques and the FedAvg algorithm for model aggregation. The system is designed to be production-grade with horizontal scaling capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train machine learning models across distributed clients without accessing their raw data, so that I can maintain data privacy while leveraging collective intelligence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client joins the federated learning network THEN the system SHALL provide the current global model without exposing other clients' data
2. WHEN a client completes local training THEN the system SHALL accept model updates without receiving raw training data
3. WHEN model aggregation occurs THEN the system SHALL combine client updates using the FedAvg algorithm
4. IF a client disconnects during training THEN the system SHALL continue operation with remaining clients

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious organization, I want differential privacy protection in the federated learning process, so that individual data points cannot be reverse-engineered from model updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends model updates THEN the system SHALL inject differential privacy noise before transmission
2. WHEN the global model is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks like MNIST
3. WHEN privacy parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of noise levels while displaying privacy-utility trade-offs
4. IF privacy budget is exceeded THEN the system SHALL prevent further model updates from that client

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a scalable server-client architecture, so that I can support multiple clients and handle varying workloads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL support at least 50 concurrent clients
2. WHEN clients connect THEN the system SHALL use gRPC for efficient model update communication
3. WHEN the coordinator service runs THEN it SHALL be deployable on AWS EC2 with horizontal scaling capabilities
4. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale resources to maintain performance
5. IF a server instance fails THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability through redundancy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want efficient model training and aggregation, so that I can minimize training time while maintaining model quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN federated training occurs THEN the system SHALL reduce training latency by at least 25% compared to centralized approaches
2. WHEN model aggregation happens THEN the system SHALL complete the FedAvg algorithm within acceptable time bounds
3. WHEN clients have varying computational capabilities THEN the system SHALL adapt training parameters accordingly
4. IF network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and compression for model updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a containerized and well-architected system, so that I can easily deploy, maintain, and extend the federated learning framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is packaged THEN it SHALL use Docker containers for consistent deployment
2. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use Flask for REST APIs and gRPC for high-performance model transfers
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL separate concerns between coordinator, client, and aggregation services
4. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL provide logging and metrics for training progress and system health
5. IF configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration management

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to work with standard deep learning frameworks and datasets, so that I can leverage existing models and validate results against known benchmarks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are defined THEN the system SHALL use PyTorch as the primary deep learning framework
2. WHEN training occurs THEN the system SHALL support CNN architectures suitable for image classification
3. WHEN validation is needed THEN the system SHALL work with standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10
4. WHEN model performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL provide accuracy metrics and convergence tracking
5. IF custom models are needed THEN the system SHALL allow easy integration of new PyTorch model architectures
